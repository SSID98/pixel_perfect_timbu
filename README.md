# Pixel Perfect Timbu

Pixel Perfect Timbu is a modification of the timbu app that uses an entirely different UI created by a designer. The app still has similar functions which is that just displays products(items) gotten from the timbu website using the timbu API and allows you to add or remove any of the products to the checkout(cart) or save items to the wishlist. This time around products can be displayed in categories. The detail of the product can also be viewed and all these information still comes from the API.

## Features

- Feature 1: You can add items to the checkout(cart) by pressing the add to cart button
- Feature 2: Pressing any of the icons on the bottom navigator bar would take you the Products screen, Wishist or Order page respectively
- Feature 3: You can remove items from the checkout screen by pressing the remove button
- Feature 4: You can save and remove items to/from the wishlist.
- Feature 5: Tapping the card of any of the products would take you to a screen with details about the products
